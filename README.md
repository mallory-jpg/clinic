The telehealth appointments at this clinic were not assigned using pre-determined options from the electronic health record system (EMR). Instead, when clinical staff scheduled appointments, the option 'Telehealth' was chosen as appointment type then the specific reason was added as a note.

* Initial data exploration showed a diversity of notation styles for each type of appointment
* The appointment types were parsed using string methods on the encompassing Pandas DataFrames

### Number of New Patients by Month vs Mask Requests
I began a campaign to distribute free COVID-19 face masks around Austin, Texas in late summer of 2020. We advertised along the local university's bus route, targeting folks under 33 (33 is Austin's average age). 
* The following graphs show a corresponding uptick in new patient enrollment for younger people under the age of 33.* 
* Our marketing campaign corresponds with an increase in younger patient enrollment up to 30%!*
